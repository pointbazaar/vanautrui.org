				Provinzial Hackathon 2018 (in Duesseldorf, Germany)
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P36I8Q4-DTE">Video</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					My Team built a Website (with Bootstrap CSS) with multiple Pages to present a 
					"Netflix for renting" business model, where people would just have to 
					interact with 1 Party (Provinzial Insurance) to choose among 3 tiers
					of subscription, which would enable them to freely choose their
					apartment in any city that is in this program. A 10% free apartments 
					rate would have to be maintained in the apartments in this program, for a given city.
					This makes life easier for the people renting and elevates Provinzial to 
					provide security by having a clear monthly subscription fee,
					without "Nebenkosten" and seperate Utilities and Internet contracts.
					Everything would already be setup. And i could change my subscription or
					the apartment i live in on a monthly basis. We thought this would vastly improve the lives
					of renters when compared to the current situation.

				Kreathon 2018 (in Krefeld, Germany)
				<a href="https://kreathon-krefeld.de/">Their current Hackathon</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					My Team built a Voice Assistant based on MyCroft to enable people to 
					ask for directions (it was Public Transport API Connected) and ask when
					to put their trash out. The thing is, MyCroft Voice recognition is not so mature,
					so our Presentation kind of failed.  Yeah. Python is crap.
				</p>
				<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
				<p>
					They improved the algorithm the Stadtwerke Krefeld were using to route their garbage trucks.
					They had an iot solution to measure how filled garbage bins were,
					and used it to route the garbage trucks. Their algorithm shortened the path of the trucks 
					by 10%, which would save 1000$+ . Clear business win.

				Energy Hack 2019 (in Essen, Germany)
				<a href="https://energy-hack.com/">Website</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					My Team built a Website (which was presented as a mobile app) which would enable Utility
					Companies, Banks and Investors to interact with, and gather information about people living in africa,
					which need loans to finance Infrastructure for Energy.
					Our prototype worked with the Factom Blockchain and provided the ability to use SMS to "pay people".
					This would enable investors and loan providers to gather information about someones finances.

				ApoBank Hackathon 2019 (in Duesseldorf, Germany)
				<a href="https://www.bankathon.net/apobank-hackathon/">Website</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					My Team built a Website (which was presented as a mobile app) where Doctors could
					sign up with their medical number, the system would detect their other information,
					including picture, and then they could ask questions and post articles,
					to exchange information, and see each other on a map.
					The idea was to enable more social interaction and enable them to share
					non-medical knowledge, e.g. related to business of their practise.
					One judge said that he found our idea to be not innovative, as it reminds him too much of
					Facebook, and that it would be just another social network. I agree with him there.
					We had other, more controversial ideas, like enabling Service Providers to interact with the doctors on the 
					Platform or to provide a "Peer-review lite" kind of experience for fast publishing of scientific knowledge,
					but discarded those.
				</p>
				<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
				<p>
					They made a financial assistant for doctors, by building a UI in React.
					It showed financial recommendations using big data and comparing your financial situation
					with other doctors, providing indicators as to performance and staff spending and so on,

				GeoHack 2019 (in Wuppertal, Germany)
				<a href="http://www.transformationsstadt.de/geohack-takeover/">Website</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					<a href="http://geohack-team-future.vanautrui.org/"> Our Prototype </a>
					My Team built a Website, where you could select administrative areas (cities) and compare them across
					some  <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/de/#/55344304442">Better Life Index</a> Dimensions.
					
					You can also zoom in to discover events and amenities, which are nearby. The idea was to be able to personalize a Map to individual
					preferences.
					Our Team won 500 Euro.
				</p>
				<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
				<p>
					The top winning team was 1 Lady. She made a presentation about how a software would work that would plan activities
					for you, based on your interest. So if you are having a vacation in some German city, that software would present various 
					events and venues and a plan for how to travel between them. She talked about Art and the local Art Scene in Wuppertal also.
					And how the local art scene could attract more visitors. This Team won 15 000 Euro, but some of it was tied to actually implementing 
					the Idea, atleast that is how i understood it.

				Journalismus Hackathon 2019 (in Essen, Germany), 5.7.2019 bis 7.7.2019
				<a href="https://www.vor-ort.nrw/2019/05/02/hackathon-hacking-local_media/">Website</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					We built a Firefox Browser Extension, <a href="https://github.com/milo2110/SwearBlock-Extension">SwearBlock Extension</a> 
					which takes swear words and hate speech and puts Emojis there instead. We recognize that this is not an elegant solution,
					as it cosumes too much CPU time, but it is a funny extension you can try out for a while. Someone in our Team said that 
					it would be interesting for Multiplayer Video Games. I personally do not believe it, but maybe.
					
					<br>
					We originally wanted to place Texts and Information in AR , but struggled to transform GPS coordinates into the local AR space.
					Also we struggled with ARCore, which we could not understand well. We wanted to display news and information in AR, maybe with 
					Overpass API, Meetup API, Local News Articles,...
				</p>
				<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
				<p>
					The top winning team (Team Ruhr Derby) built a game where Players could compete in a quiz
					about local knowledge and statistical data about the local Region. The prototype permitted only
					Bots to compete with. In the game there would be articles about the local Region, relevant to the Quiz,
					by local Newspapers. So it would give them traffic to their website. That was their selling point.

				PropTech Hackathon 2019 (in Cologne, Germany), 20.9.2019 bis 22.9.2019

						<h3>What we built</h3>
						<p>
							Our Concept was for a Security Robot. We called it "SecBot".
							It was inspired by <a href="https://www.knightscope.com/">KnightScope</a>,
							a comany which is making Security Robots in America. So we bought a small and cheap (50$) 
							programmable Robot platfrom from Conrad Electronics, and put a Raspberry Pi with a Webcam on top.
							Streaming of the video worked great. We also had an application for Facial Recognition.
							Our Presentation was about how security robots would in some situations be more cost-effective than static security cameras
							and security staff.

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
						<p>
							Andrey Bogomolov's Team won the Hack with a Vue.js Webapp "MyButler".
							The Concept was about having a small device in the houses, and an App, which
							would facilitate Communication between tenants and Landlords. So it could speed up
							the whole thing, so that landlords and tenants would not have to communicate by snail mail.
							And there could be Ads placed in the App for various home-related services.

				DoHack 2019 (in Dortmunt, Germany), 27.9.2019 bis 29.9.2019
				<a href="https://dohack.io/">Website</a>
				<h3>what we built</h3>
				<p>
					Our Team built an App for Citizens to send a picture,location and optionally personal information to 
					a 'hero' dashboard for police, ambulance and some companies about security incidents such as vandalism,
					car accidents, violence and the like. The idea was that this would encourage people to notify the authorities.
					Because many people do not want to call the police because they do not want to give out their identity to them,
					and maybe because they do not have time to talk with them on the phone.
					This app would provide a quick way to notify the authorities.
				</p>
				<h3>What a winning team built</h3>
				<p>
					A winning team built an app where you could 'adopt' green spaces in the city and care for them.
					You could adopt them in the app, and then plant stuff there. The idea was to encourage people
					taking care of the environment and doing environmental stewardship.
					Each green space would have its own page on their website. So you could post updates and pictures.
					It would enable people to have a green space to care for even if they do not have their own garden.
					And it would improve the city.
