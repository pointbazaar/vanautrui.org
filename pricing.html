		<p>
			These are just rough guidelines. <br>
			We will always make a detailed Quote which depends
			on what is required.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Web Development and Web Design starts from <strong> 200 €</strong>.
			<br>
			Our Ecommerce Development starts from <strong> 400 €</strong>.
			<br>
			Our Android App Development starts from <strong> 300 €</strong>.
			<br>
			If your Project requires a custom Backend, we do that from <strong> 500 €</strong>.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We have never done a project over 20 000 €. Just so you can have a clear picture of where we are at.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your Project has an Ecommerce or a Backend, that almost always requires Support and Maintenance.<br>
			We provide Support and Maintenance Packages from <strong> 50 € / month</strong>. <br>
			Of course you are freeto choose another Provider or to maintain the Project yourself.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			How do we handle Payment? <br>
			We take 25% of the Project Budget as a Commitment Fee Upfront,<br>
			then start work on the Project. If you are satisfied with the final Results, after revisions<br>
			and changes have been requested and implemented, you pay the rest of the Budget.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If there is disagreement about the Project <br>
			or you are not satisfied, we will try to fix it. <br>
			
			<strong>You will not get the initial 25% back.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no possibility of doing the final Payment in Parts or over a longer Period of time.<br>
			
			The final payment is due 30 days after the Project has been finished. <br>
			If the final Payment is not delivered, 
			no further steps will be taken, we will simply stop doing business with you.
