                    <h3>Business Website</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="card-text">
                    You have a Small Business but no website?
                    a strong web presence can bring in more clients.

                    Today's clients often don't have the patience
                    to call companies about their needs.

                    <br>

                    They expect to see everything they
                    need on the companies website.<br>

                    This is especially true if your
                    company has no physical presence in the city,
                    which can often be costly.<br>

                    Instead these companies rely on
                    moving the point of sale to wherever
                    the customer is at the moment:
                    Walking through the city, seeing an ad,
                    watching a video of their friends wearing your product,
                    or seeing a promotion of your product on youtube.
                    <br>
                    However these platforms control your content.
                    If you want the customer to see you how
                    you want to be seen and really give them all
                    the information they need, a website is a good choice.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    You can also choose a site-builder like
                    <a href="wix.com">wix.com</a> or <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/"> jimdo.com</a>.
                    <br>
                    They will however give you only limited control.
                    As soon as you require features such as :
                    <ul>
                    <li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    it is the right time to work with professionals.

                        The Question is not if a company should

                        Now more than ever are people using smartphones to buy and sell
                        goods and make purchasing decisions.

                        A mobile app gives your company greater control over the user
                        experience than a website can.

                Although some people prefer to order in-person,
                an App saves your waiters time, and the customer
                can find their favorite food more effectively,
                e.g. with filters for allergies or to see only
                Vegan Food.
