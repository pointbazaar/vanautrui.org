                </div>
                <div class="card-text">
                  You have a Small Business but no website?
                  a strong web presence can bring in more clients.

                  Today's clients often don't have the patience
                  to call companies about their needs.

                  <br>

                  They expect to see everything they
                  need on the companies website.<br>

                  This is especially true if your
                  company has no physical presence in the city,
                  which can often be costly.<br>

                  Instead these companies rely on
                  moving the point of sale to wherever
                  the customer is at the moment:
                  Walking through the city, seeing an ad,
                  watching a video of their friends wearing your product,
                  or seeing a promotion of your product on youtube.
                  <br>
                  However these platforms control your content.
                  If you want the customer to see you how
                  you want to be seen and really give them all
                  the information they need, a website is a good choice.
                  <br>
                  <a href="https://www.inc.com/associated-press/small-businesses-have-no-website.html">
                    About 55% of Small Businesses don't have a website
                  </a>
                  <br>
                  You can also choose a site-builder like
                  <a href="wix.com">wix.com</a> or <a href="https://www.jimdo.com/"> jimdo.com</a>.
                  <br>
                  They will however give you only limited control.
                  As soon as you require features such as :

                      Now more than ever are people using smartphones to buy and sell
                      goods and make purchasing decisions.

                      A mobile app gives your company greater control over the user
                      experience than a website can.

                      Take Deliveroo or other food delivery companies for example.
                      Their Business would become expensive if they had to equip

                an App saves your waiters time, and the customer
                can find their favorite food more effectively,
                e.g. with filters for allergies or to see only
