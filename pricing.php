		<p>
			If a Project is over 2000 €, we break it down into smaller Projects to be done in sequence.<br>
      This lowers the Risk for us and the Client.
		</p>
		<p>
			If your Project has an Ecommerce or a Backend, <br>
            that always requires Hosting and usually also requires Maintenance and Support.<br>
            We provide <strong>Hosting and Maintenance Packages </strong>from <strong> 50 € / month</strong>. <br>
			Of course you are freeto choose another Provider or to maintain and host the Project yourself.
		</p>

		<p>
			How do we handle Payment? <br>

            <strong>We take 25% of the Project Budget as a Commitment Fee Upfront,</strong>
                <br>
			then start work on the Project. If you are satisfied with the final Results, after revisions<br>
			and changes have been requested and implemented, you pay the rest of the Budget.
		</p>

		<p>
			If there is disagreement about the Project <br>
			or you are not satisfied, we will try to fix it. <br>

			<strong>You will not get the initial 25% back.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no possibility of doing the final Payment in Parts or over a longer Period of time.<br>

			The final payment is due 30 days after the Project has been finished. <br>
			If the final Payment is not delivered,
			no further steps will be taken, we will simply stop doing business with you.
		</p>
